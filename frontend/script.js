   J.A.R.V.I.S Frontend — Main Application Logic
   ================================================================

   ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
   ---------------------
   This file powers the entire frontend of the J.A.R.V.I.S AI assistant.
   It handles:

   1. CHAT MESSAGING — The user types (or speaks) a message, which is
      sent to the backend via a POST request. The backend responds using
      Server-Sent Events (SSE), allowing the reply to stream in
      token-by-token (like ChatGPT's typing effect).

   2. TEXT-TO-SPEECH (TTS) — When TTS is enabled, the backend also
      sends base64-encoded audio chunks inside the SSE stream. These
      are queued up and played sequentially through a single <audio>
      element. This queue-based approach prevents overlapping audio
      and supports mobile browsers (especially iOS/Safari).

   3. SPEECH RECOGNITION — The Web Speech API captures the user's
      voice, transcribes it in real time, and auto-sends the final
      transcript as a chat message.

   4. ANIMATED ORB — A WebGL-powered visual orb (rendered by a
      separate OrbRenderer class) acts as a visual indicator. It
      "activates" when J.A.R.V.I.S is speaking and goes idle otherwise.

   5. MODE SWITCHING — The UI supports two modes:
      - "General" mode  → uses the /chat/stream endpoint
      - "Realtime" mode → uses the /chat/realtime/stream endpoint
      The mode determines which backend pipeline processes the message.

   6. SESSION MANAGEMENT — A session ID is returned by the server on
      the first message. Subsequent messages include that ID so the
      backend can maintain conversation context. Starting a "New Chat"
      clears the session.

   DATA FLOW (simplified):
   User input → sendMessage() → POST to backend → SSE stream opens →
   tokens arrive as JSON chunks → rendered into the DOM in real time →
   optional audio chunks are enqueued in TTSPlayer → played sequentially.

   ================================================================ */

 * API — The base URL for all backend requests.
 *
 * In production, this resolves to the same origin the page was loaded from
 * (e.g., "https://jarvis.example.com"). During local development, it falls
 * back to "http://localhost:8000" (the default FastAPI dev server port).
 *
 * `window.location.origin` gives us the protocol + host + port of the

   TTS AUDIO PLAYER (Text-to-Speech Queue System)
   ================================================================

   HOW THE TTS QUEUE WORKS — EXPLAINED FOR LEARNERS
   -------------------------------------------------
   When TTS is enabled, the backend doesn't send one giant audio file.
   Instead, it sends many small base64-encoded MP3 *chunks* as part of
   the SSE stream (one chunk per sentence or phrase). This approach has
   two advantages:
     1. Audio starts playing before the full response is generated
        (lower latency — the user hears the first sentence immediately).
     2. Each chunk is small, so there's no long download wait.

   The TTSPlayer works like a conveyor belt:
     - enqueue() adds a new audio chunk to the end of the queue.
     - _playLoop() picks up chunks one by one and plays them.
     - When a chunk finishes playing (audio.onended), the loop moves
       to the next chunk.
     - When the queue is empty and no more chunks are arriving, playback
       stops and the orb goes back to idle.

   WHY A SINGLE <audio> ELEMENT?
   iOS Safari has strict autoplay policies — it only allows audio
   playback from a user-initiated event. By reusing one <audio> element
   that was "unlocked" during a user gesture, all subsequent plays
   through that same element are allowed. Creating new Audio() objects
   each time would trigger autoplay blocks on iOS.

   ================================================================ */

    /**

     *   queue    — Array of base64 audio strings waiting to be played.

     *   enabled  — True if the user has toggled TTS on (via the speaker button).
     *   stopped  — True if playback was forcibly stopped (e.g., new chat).
     *              This prevents queued audio from playing after a stop.

     * Safari) allow subsequent programmatic playback.

     *
     * It does two things:
     *   1. Plays a tiny silent WAV file on the <audio> element, which
     *      tells the browser "the user initiated audio playback."
     *   2. Creates a brief AudioContext oscillator at zero volume — this
     *      unlocks the Web Audio API context on iOS (a separate lock from
     *      the <audio> element).
     *
     * After this, the browser treats subsequent .play() calls on the same

     * callback (like our SSE stream handler).

   SPEECH RECOGNITION (Speech-to-Text)
   ================================================================

   HOW SPEECH RECOGNITION WORKS — EXPLAINED FOR LEARNERS
   ------------------------------------------------------
   The Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) is a browser-native feature
   that converts spoken audio from the microphone into text. Here's
   the lifecycle:

   1. User clicks the mic button → startListening() is called.
   2. recognition.start() begins capturing audio from the mic.
   3. As the user speaks, the browser fires 'result' events with
      partial (interim) transcripts. We display these in the input
      field in real time so the user sees what's being recognized.
   4. When the user pauses, the browser finalizes the transcript
      (result.isFinal becomes true).
   5. On finalization, we stop listening and automatically send the
      recognized text as a chat message.

   IMPORTANT PROPERTIES:
   - continuous: false → Stops after one utterance (sentence). If true,
     it would keep listening for multiple sentences.
   - interimResults: true → We get partial results as the user speaks
     (not just the final result). This gives real-time feedback.
   - lang: 'en-US' → Optimize recognition for American English.

   BROWSER SUPPORT: Chrome has the best support. Firefox and Safari
   have limited or no support for this API. We gracefully degrade by
   checking if the API exists before using it.
   ================================================================ */

   SEND MESSAGE + SSE STREAMING
   ================================================================

   HOW SSE (Server-Sent Events) STREAMING WORKS — EXPLAINED FOR LEARNERS
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Instead of waiting for the entire AI response to generate (which
   could take seconds), we use SSE streaming to receive the response
   token-by-token as it's generated. This creates the "typing" effect.

   STANDARD SSE FORMAT:
   The server sends a stream of lines like:
     data: {"chunk": "Hello"}
     data: {"chunk": " there"}
     data: {"chunk": "!"}
     data: {"done": true}

   Each line starts with "data: " followed by a JSON payload. Lines
   are separated by newlines ("\n"). An empty line separates events.

   HOW WE READ THE STREAM:
   1. We POST the user's message to the backend.
   2. The server responds with Content-Type: text/event-stream.
   3. We use res.body.getReader() to read the response body as a
      stream of raw bytes (Uint8Array chunks).
   4. We decode each chunk to text and append it to an SSE buffer.
   5. We split the buffer by newlines and process each complete line.
   6. Lines starting with "data: " are parsed as JSON.
   7. Each JSON payload may contain:
      - chunk: a piece of the text response (appended to the UI)
      - audio: a base64 MP3 segment (enqueued for TTS playback)
      - session_id: the conversation ID (saved for future messages)
      - error: an error message from the server
      - done: true when the response is complete

   WHY NOT USE EventSource?
   The native EventSource API only supports GET requests. We need POST
   (to send the message body), so we use fetch() + manual SSE parsing.

   THE SSE BUFFER:
   Network chunks don't align with SSE line boundaries — one chunk
   might contain half a line, or multiple lines. The sseBuffer variable
   accumulates raw text. We split by '\n', process all complete lines,
   and keep the last (potentially incomplete) line in the buffer for
   the next iteration.

 *   3. Show a typing indicator while waiting for the server.
 *   4. Lock the UI (isStreaming = true, disable send button).
 *   5. Reset the TTS player and unlock audio for iOS.
 *   6. POST to the appropriate endpoint based on currentMode.
 *   7. Read the SSE stream chunk by chunk.
 *   8. For each data line: parse JSON, append text to the DOM,
 *      enqueue audio, save session ID.
 *   9. When done, clean up the streaming cursor and unlock the UI.
 *  10. On error, show an error message in the chat.
